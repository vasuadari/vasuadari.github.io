              <p>I first learned typing in a typewriter class. I loved the sharp, rhythmic noise the keys made, and even the silly mistakes felt like part of the journey. My goal was simple: increase speed while making fewer errors. Back then, I saw it as the first step toward using a computer.</p>

              <p>When I joined my first job, I noticed some engineers typing effortlessly without looking at their keyboards, flying across black terminals. That immediately became my next obsession. Later, I learned it had a name—<code>touch typing</code>—and I’ve believed ever since that it’s a must-have skill that should be taught in schools. It’s one of the simplest ways to boost productivity. I’ve always been a fan of keyboard shortcuts; there’s something magical about pressing a few keys and watching things happen instantly.</p>

              <p>The terminal was the next thing that caught my attention. Every engineer eventually has to manage servers, so I started learning Linux from scratch. Linux is a file-based system, and to get around you inevitably need to know the basics of the <code>vi editor</code>. The first time I opened vi, I had to google how to exit. Coming from a GUI world, navigating files in vi felt like a struggle.</p>

              <p>At first, I only knew about <em>insert</em> and <em>normal</em> mode, and I relied heavily on the ↑ ↓ ← → arrow keys to move around. I probably survived that way for six months to a year. But as I began managing more servers, relying on just the arrows became frustrating. That’s when I dug deeper into vi. Back then, documentation was a bit fragmented, but one great thing about vi is that it ships with its own tutorial—you just need to follow it. The very first lesson I learned: <code>don’t use arrow keys, use h, j, k, and l.</code></p>

              <p>By then my typing had improved, but I found the key repeat on macOS painfully slow. An engineer showed me how to tweak the setting, and it felt like bliss. From there, things clicked. I discovered in-built keymaps (keyboard shortcuts), registers, and even the basics of find-and-replace patterns. My productivity doubled. After that point, I switched my development environment to vi and, eventually, Vim.</p>

              <p>Once you use vi/Vim for writing code, the mouse feels like a burden. Vim is an improved version of vi, and its community exploded thanks to its plugin ecosystem. Pretty much anything you can imagine has a plugin—syntax highlighting, color themes, powerline status bars, fuzzy search, file navigation, and more. Once you reach this stage, you curate a core set of plugins that keeps your productivity at its peak. Recently, I moved to <code>Neovim</code> for its Lua-based plugin support, and paired it with <code>Alacritty</code> to accelerate terminal performance. The combination is pure joy.</p>

              <p>Looking back, learning Vim wasn’t just about editing files faster—it taught me the value of mastering tools deeply. What started with typewriter clacks turned into a philosophy of working with precision and flow.</p>
